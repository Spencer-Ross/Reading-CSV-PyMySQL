To Run the program execute
	python3 pythonDB.py 'password to server'

If it is executed without a password token the program will default to using
"password" for the password of the SQL server.

The database will then be created and data read from the CSV file that must be
in the same folder as the python script.

NOTE: this program uses a pandas library, so must have Pandas installed.
		pip3 install pandas
